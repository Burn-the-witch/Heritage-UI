						"513761816": "Mark Faba (a.k.a. “The Undying”) is an explosives expert and freelance assassin with a penchant for violent, theatrical spectacles.<br><br>A disgraced MI5 agent, Faba has developed a unique “shock and awe” methodology inspired in equal terms by terrorism and performance art. He goes to great lengths to assassinate his targets as loudly and viscerally as possible.<br><br>Present at the site of an IRA bombing in London, 10-year old Mark Faba experienced the power and spectacle of terrorism at close hand. Traumatised, the young boy withdrew from society, resorted to living in his parents' basement outside school hours and deeply embedded himself in the world of hobby electronics and hacking.<br><br>At 18, he had become smitten with the flamboyance of the late 1980's hacker scene. But after a series of hacks against the government, Faba was arrested and given a non-choice. Hone his skills with the Secret Service and work for Queen and country or face years of incarceration.<br><br>At MI5, Faba became an ace marksman and demolitions expert. He learned infiltration techniques and worked for years on domestic surveillance projects aimed at journalists, politicians, corporate heads and members of the upper class. Eventually, the work peeled away every shred of decency and humanity and the boundaries between right and wrong dissolved.<br><br>While on a job to install surveillance equipment in the hotel suite of a visiting foreign diplomat, Fab’s cover was blown. A struggle ensued and Faba ended up killing his intended surveillance target. He tried to cover his tracks but forensic experts at MI5 soon suspected foul play. As the evidence mounted, Faba felt the ground burn beneath him. In his desperation, he turned to his old hacker connections and with their aid, Mark Faba disappeared from the world. Soon after, he was presumed dead by his own hand.<br><br>Flash forward ten years. When an MI6 agent was murdered under spectacular circumstances, the investigation revealed that Mark Faba was in fact alive and working as a freelance assassin in various conflict zones around the world.<br><br> An ICA contract was issued on Faba, requesting his immediate termination.<br><br>The agency dispatched one of its most seasoned agents, who successfully assassinated Faba in Somalia. Or so it seemed. A few years later, however, Faba reappeared in Kosovo alive and well, and so began one of the most enigmatic cases in ICA history. From that initial contract to the present day, ICA has confirmed the death of Faba no less than 25 times. Yet somehow, he keeps reappearing, growing bolder with every unsuccessful attempt – even having the audacity to send us clues to his whereabouts.<br><br>Faba - with the internal nickname \"The Undying\" - has proven to be an un-erasable embarrassment for the agency. And now, he has send us another taunting invitation: \"If you're not busy, come to Miami during the innovation race. It's sure to be a crowd pleaser.\"<br><br>The Board has decided that enough is enough. This time, they’re sending their absolute best. If anyone can send Faba to an early – and not to mention permanent - grave, it is you 47."

						"773185078": "Mark Faba was always a strange kid. Born to a firefighting father with a serious alcohol problem and an overworked mother working two jobs as a secretary in the iron and steel industry, Mark was left to his own devices from an early age. He spent his formative years living in his parents' basement and deeply embedded himself in the world of hobby electronics, phone phreaking and eventually computer hacking.<br><br>\r\nAt 18, he found his calling as part of the underground computer hacking scene and sought to make himself a name by performing spectacular penetrations into corporate systems. After a series of hacks against the government, Faba was arrested by MI5 and placed in custody. Here, he was given a non-choice. Hone his skills with the Secret Service and work for England or face years of incarceration.<br><br>\r\nFaba spent two decades with MI5. He became an expert at demolitions and marksmanship. He learned infiltration techniques and grew his expertise at espionage, working for years on domestic surveillance projects aimed at journalists, politicians, corporate heads and members of the upper class. The stress and nature of his work got to Faba and one day, everything collapsed.<br><br>\r\nWhile on a mission to install surveillance equipment in the hotel suite of a visiting foreign diplomat, Faba was discovered. A struggle ensued and Faba ended up killing his intended surveillance target. Desperate and fearful of what might happen, Faba worked through the night to fake the circumstances around the man's death. Unfortunately, forensic experts at MI5 soon suspected foul play and as the evidence mounted, Faba felt the ground burn beneath him. In his desperation, he turned to an old bounty hunter connection and with their aid, Mark Faba disappeared from the world and was eventually presumed dead by his own hand. <br><br>\r\nFive years later, MI6 discovered a connection between of one their agents, who had been assassinated a year prior, and Mark Faba. Investigating the lead further provided vague indications that Faba was alive and was working as an assassin in various conflict zones around the world. An ICA contract was issued on Faba, requesting that he be terminated. The ICA sent one of their agents and assassinated Faba while on a mission in Somalia. However, Faba reappeared in Kosovo a few months later and so began one of the most enigmatic cases in ICA history. From that initial contract until present day, the ICA has confirmed the death of Faba more than 20 times and somehow, he keeps reappearing.<br><br>\r\nFaba has been given the nickname \"The Undying\" and has proven to be an un-erasable embarrassment for the ICA.",

						"1727328897": "Initially no more remarkable than any other navy brat, Allison Moretta came into her particular skillset by reinventing herself each time she transferred schools. When her family life finally settled, Moretta didn't leave her rolodex of personas behind. She realized she could apply these skills to insert herself into more desirable circumstances and lives than her own with much less effort than working her way up honestly through tedious desk jobs and references.<br>Her first known kill was an executive assistant whose deep involvement in her employer's life made her a perpetual obstacle in Moretta's efforts. Rather than being an uncharacteristic loss of control, this murder only emboldened her further. She became less likely to flee when a situation turned, electing in many cases to simply assassinate troublesome individuals in whatever way was most convenient to her current scheme. <br>Being adept at of mirroring peoples' own qualities back to them, Moretta ingratiates herself as a kindred spirit to those in positions to improve her lifestyle or image. She transfers whatever assets she can access, disposes of any obstacles (living or otherwise), and disappears into a fresh alias when the time comes. Unlike the typical con-artist, her ambitions are more complicated than accumulation of wealth; to Moretta, assets are only a means to an end. Her goal is to found an art gallery and move in the privileged spaces of dealers, collectors and true connoisseurs. She has spent much of her adult life maneuvering herself  closer to this goal, and she is now on the precipice of achieving it.<br>Known aliases include: Ann Maurice, Alice Moretz, Emily Ansel"

Brilliant young hacktivist and suspect in a dozen cases of cyber vandalism. Using onion routing with state-of-the-art encryption, Hall went through a lot of trouble to stay untraceable. She is good, but we are better. Her digital trail has led us to a remote farm in Colorado, where satellite footage has revealed what appears to be the training camp for a private militia. Led by an already registered target, Sean Rose, Australian environmental terrorist and explosives expert, wanted for a series of public bombings. Rose was spotted near the scene of Thomas Cross’ kidnapping, which makes him our prime suspect for the shadow client. Spurred by Erich Soders, the ICA board of directors has asked us to infiltrate the farm and assassinate Sean Rose along with three other prominent militia members. Ezra Berg, retired Mossad interrogator. Penelope Graves, former Interpol anti-terror analyst. And finally, Maya Parvati, former assassin and gunrunner for the Tamil Tigers. I’ll be honest with you, 47. I consider Erich Soders’ reasoning hasty and ill-advised. Now, we cannot go against the wishes of the board. But we can conduct our own investigation.

This is your objective as well. Now listen carefully. ICA exams aren’t normally this difficult. Not only was the airfield a virtual fortress, he even added additional guards.

Now, it is unclear when Janus stepped down as the Constant, but since 2004 he has been a resident of a quiet community in suburban Vermont.<br><br>But there’s a catch.

Given that he is now unable to travel the streets of Marrakesh on his own, he will have to use his fixer to hand the diamonds over to a courier somewhere in the city's marketplace. The target is a skilled covert operator and is unlikely to be simply carrying the diamonds himself.

And Steven Bradley, technical wizard and the brains behind Haven’s proprietary software platform.\r\n<br>\r\nWith the owners gone, Olivia will be able to penetrate the Haven servers long enough for her to secure the new partner identities.\r\n<br>\r\nI’ve uploaded all the information we have on the island and the three targets. Best of luck, gentlemen."
